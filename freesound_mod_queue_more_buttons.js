We would love to publish it but could you possibly add English title, description and tags first?

You can keep the original description and simply add the English text. This will ensure that your sounds are discoverable in the search, as our website and user-base primarily work with English.

Also, please include as much detail as you can in the description/tags.

To edit the title/description/keywords: 1. Click the sound name on the right 2. Click "Edit sound description" 3. When done, click "Save sound description"

Many thanks!`

If it is yours, can you please edit title/tags/description to be descriptive of the sound, so it can be found using search?
To edit: 1. Click the sound name on the right 2. Click "Edit sound description" 3. When done, click "Save sound description"

Freesound only hosts files that are not copyright infringing. We reject audio taken from copyright protected media without permission. Please do not upload work owned by others. Only sounds that you have made yourself or own the copyright.

Additional comment: archive.org might be an appropriate place for archiving memes. On freesound, copyright is core and it is mostly impossible to clarify the legal status of random memes.

If you would like to find out what you can upload, please take a look at https://freesound.org/help/faq/#what-sounds-are-legal-to-put-on-freesound

Thank you for your understanding!`

If yours: could you please add to the description in general terms how it was made?
If not yours: please let us know from where so we can check the copyright situation.
To edit the sound info: 1. Click the sound name on the right 2. Click "Edit sound description" 3. When done, click "Save sound description"`
